# Kit Search
### Search tracking information

This is a proof of concept exercise to demonstrate how to fetch shipping data from an api endpoint and allow a user to search the data using an autocomplete component.

## Installation

Requirements: Node >= 16.x, npm >= 8.x

This applications consists of two separate parts: a server for handling back end API requests
and a front end client build with React.  Installation consists of running a single installation
script:

`npm run install-all`

Once that installation succeeds, you will need to seed the database.

`npm run seed`

## Running

To start the both the client and server applications:
`npm run server-client`

By default, the client runs on port 3000 and the server runs on port 3001.

Open http://localhost:3000 to see the autocomplete search form.
